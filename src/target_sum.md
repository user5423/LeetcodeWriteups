## Solution 1 (DP Recursion)

Runtime: **368 ms**, faster than **66.11%** of Python3 online submissions for Target Sum.
Memory Usage: **15.1 MB**, less than **50.57%** of Python3 online submissions for Target Sum.

This uses basic DP recursion to count the number of possible expressions with the given numbers can be laid out to reach the target sum

[Python Code Implementation](target_sum.py)

## Solution 2 (Bottom up DP)

**TODO** Implement this
